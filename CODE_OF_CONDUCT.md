Code of Conduct
===============

Come in and make yourself at home!

This is a project conveyed in the authors' free time. It is their little
act of charity to make this world an (even) better place.
It will most likely pass unnoticed, but if you happen to find it useful,
informative, amusing, or stimulating, we're happy for you.

Please be civilised, well-mannered, and courteous. Primum non nocere.
Let us all strive to be better versions of ourselves, exercise forgiveness
and generosity, and assume good faith in others.

We are looking forward to your contributions and ideas.
