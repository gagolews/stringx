> English is the native language for only 5% of the World population.

[*stringx*](https://stringx.gagolewski.com/) replaces base
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) functions such as
`paste`, `gregexpr`, `tolower`, etc., with ones that:

* work in the same way on every platform,
* support a wide range of languages and scripts,
* fix some annoying inconsistencies in the base R functions
(which are pointed out in the package [manual](https://stringx.gagolewski.com)).


[**stringx**](https://stringx.gagolewski.com/) is a set of wrappers around
[*stringi*](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/) — a mature
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) package for
fast, consistent, convenient, and portable string/text/natural language
processing in any locale that relies on
[ICU – International Components for Unicode](http://site.icu-project.org/).
