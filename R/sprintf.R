# sprintf:
#      Field widths and precisions of '%s' conversions are interpreted as
#      bytes, not characters, as described in the C standard.


# There is a limit of 8192 bytes on elements of 'fmt',

#      The coercion is done only once, so if 'length(fmt) > 1' then all
#      elements must expect the same types of arguments.

# only 1$..99$, but this seems like a sensible limit

# Zero-length arguments are allowed and will give a zero-length result.
