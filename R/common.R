# we are often outputting character vectors,
# hence, some assumptions are made below.

# if a function is vectorised wrt 2 arguments, it should
# preserve the attributes of both inputs (if of the same length)


# string functions: character vectors in, character vector out
# in non-character on input, then converted with...
# as.character()? but this drops all attributes

# the type designers themselves should define the semantics
# which attributes they would like to preserve?

# character vectors in, logical/numeric out -- a different story
# names, dim, dimnames - yes
# tsp - ?
