stringx: Drop-in replacements for base R string functions powered by stringi
============================================================================

    English is the native language for only 5% of the World population.
    Also, only 17% of us can understand this text. Moreover, the Latin alphabet
    is the main one for merely 36% of the total. The early computer era,
    now a very long time ago, was dominated by the US. Due to the proliferation
    of the internet, smartphones, social media, and other technologies
    and communication platforms, this is no longer the case.
    This package replaces base R string functions with ones that fully
    support the Unicode standards related to natural language processing.
    Thanks to `ICU <http://site.icu-project.org/>`_
    (International Components for Unicode) and
    `stringi <https://stringi.gagolewski.com/>`_,
    they are fast, reliable, and portable across different platforms.

`R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_'s ambitions go far beyond being merely the
"free software environment for statistical computing and graphics".
It has proven effective in programming whole data analysis pipelines:
from information gathering through knowledge discovery to communication
of results.

Modern data science is no longer just about crunching numbers.
Text is a rich source of new knowledge â€” from natural language
processing to bioinformatics. It also gives powerful
means to represent or transfer unstructured data.

*stringx* brings `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_ string processing
abilities into the 21st century.
It replaces functions such
as `paste`, `grep`, `tolower`, `strftime`, `sprintf`, etc., with ones that:

*   support a wide range of languages and scripts and
    fully conform to `Unicode <https://www.unicode.org/>`_ standards
    (see also `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n2nlPHEMG8>`_),
*   work in the same way on every platform,
*   fix some long-standing inconsistencies in the base R functions
    (related to vectorisation, handling of missing values,
    preservation of attributes, order of arguments, etc.;
    they are all thoroughly documented in this online manual,
    happy reading! ðŸ¤“),
*   are more forward-pipe (`|>` or `magrittr::%>%`) operator-friendly.


Also, a few new, useful operations are introduced.

.. code-block:: r

    suppressMessages(library("stringx"))

    c("ACTGCT", "42", "stringx \U0001f970") |> grepv2("\\p{EMOJI_PRESENTATION}")
    ## [1] "stringx ðŸ¥°"

    toupper("gro\u00DF")  # replaces base::toupper()
    ## [1] "GROSS"

    l <- c("e", "e\u00b2", "\u03c0", "\u03c0\u00b2", "\U0001f602\U0001f603")
    r <- c(exp(1), exp(2), pi, pi^2, NaN)
    cat(sprintf("%8s=%+.3f", l, r), sep="\n")  # replaces base::sprintf()
    ##        e=+2.718
    ##       eÂ²=+7.389
    ##        Ï€=+3.142
    ##       Ï€Â²=+9.870
    ##     ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ƒ= NaN

..  COMMENT

    but we do not aim to fix the whole nam.ING_meSS

    99% compatible (cannot be 100% as they use a different regex engine,
    for example, and some inconsistencies are quite obvious and can be a push
    for a change in the right direction)

    * collator - portable (locales),  Unicode-correct (normalisation)
    * date/time - portable (locales)
    * iconv - portable
    * regex - Unicode-correct, portable
    * speed
