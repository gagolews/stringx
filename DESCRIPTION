Description: English is the native language for only 5% of the World population,
    and only 17% can understand this text. Moreover, the Latin alphabet is the
    main one for merely 36% of us. The early computer era, very long time ago,
    was dominated by the US. Due to the proliferation of the internet,
    smart phones, social media, and other technologies, this is no longer
    the case. This package replaces all base R string functions with ones
    that fully support the Unicode standards related to natural language
    processing. Thanks to ICU (International Components for Unicode) and
    stringi, they are fast, reliable, and portable across different platforms.
